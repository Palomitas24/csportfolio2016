<h2> Motherboard</h2>

<p> Motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) 
found in general purpose microcomputers and other expandable systems. 
Prior to the invention of the microprocessor, a digital computer
consisted of multiple printed circuit boards in a card-cage case 
with components connected by a backplane, a set of interconnected
sockets. 
</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>In very old designs, copper wires were the discrete 
connections between card connector pins, but printed circuit 
boards soon became the standard practice. The Central Processing Unit 
(CPU), memory, and peripherals were housed on individual printed 
circuit boards, which were plugged into the backplate. 
The ubiquitous S-100 bus of the 1970s is an example of this type 
of backplane system</p>

<h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU) </h2>
<img height="250" src="http://grephaxs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cpu.jpg"> 
<p>Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry 
within the computer that carries out the instructions of a 
computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, 
control, and input/output operations specified by the instructions .
</p>

<h3> History</h3>
<p>In the early 1950s, 
each computer design was unique. There were no upward-compatible 
machines or computer architectures with multiple, differing 
implementations. Programs written for one machine would run on no 
other kind, even other kinds from the same company. This was not a 
major drawback then because no large body of software had been 
developed to run on computers, so starting programming from scratch 
was not seen as a large barrier.</p>

<h2>Random-access memories (RAM)</h2>
<img height="250" src="https://www.defit.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ram.jpg">  
<p>Random-access memories (RAM) is a form of computer data
storage, allows data items to be read or written in almost 
the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of
the data inside the memory.
</p>

<h3> History</h3>
<p>  A vacuum tube or thermionic valve could be used to create 
an electrical signal by controlling electrons movements in a vacuum 
of space. The Geissler Tube was developed by Heinrich Geissler in 
1857. The Crookes Tube was developed by William Crookes. Many 
scientist in the 19th century experimented with vacuum tubes, Eugen 
Goldstein, Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. In the 1940's research 
was conducted on cathode ray tubes as data storage. In 1946 Sir
Fredrick Williams and Tom Kilburn co invent the Williams Tube , a 
type of cathode ray tube. In 1948 Kilburn designed the Manchester
Baby- the first computer to use a stored program. </p>

<h2>Hard Drive</h2>
<img height="250" src="http://www.repairyourpcnow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/hard-drive-02.jpg"> 
</p>A hard drive is a high-capacity, self-contained storage
device containing a read-write mechanism plus one or more hard 
disks, inside a sealed unit. Also called hard disk drive.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p> The IBM 350 Disk File, invented by Reynold Johnson, was 
introduced in 1956 with the IBM 305 RAMAC computer. This drive had
fifty 24-inch (0.6 m) platters, with a total capacity of five
million 6-bit characters (3.75 megabytes). The first disk drive to
use removable media was the IBM 1311 drive.</p>

<h2>BUS</h2>
<img height="200" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/PCIExpress.jpg">
<p> A BUS is a communication system that transfers data between
components inside a computer, or between computers.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Early computer buses were bundles of wire that attached computer
memory and peripherals. Anecdotally termed the "digit trunk", they 
were named after electrical power buses, or busbars. Almost always,
there was one bus for memory, and one or more separate buses for
peripherals. These were accessed by separate instructions, with 
completely different timings and protocols.</p>

<h2>Keyboard</h2>
<img height="250" src="http://g02.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1WwKqGVXXXXXfXXXXq6xXFXXXS/222259555/HTB1WwKqGVXXXXXfXXXXq6xXFXXXS.jpg">
<p>A keyboard is the set of typewriter-like keys that enables you 
to enter data into a computer or other devices. Computer keyboards
are similar to electric-typewriters but contain additional typing 
keys.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Keyboards and typing technology have come a long way over the 
past couple centuries. The first typing devices were designed and 
patented in the 1700s while the first manufactured typing devices 
came about in the 1870s. These machines featured “blind typing” 
technology, where characters were printed on upside-down pages 
that remained unseen until completion. Since then, we have seen 
several updates in design, layout, technology, and function that
are more efficient and user-friendly. The type-writer has changed
shape dramatically over the years, eventually becoming electronic-
then practically obsolete as we moved into the age of computers
and the birth of the keyboard. The keyboard is the number one
computer interface used around the world, and an integral object 
for many of us that most people take for granted. This paper will
explore the history of typing, detailing the innovations across 
time that have accumulated  into the definition of today’s 
standard for the ultimate typing experience.

<h2>Mouse</h2>

<p>A computer mouse is an input device that is most often used 
with a personal computer. Moving a mouse along a flat surface can
move the on-screen cursor to different items on the screen. Items 
can be moved or selected by pressing the mouse buttons (called 
clicking).</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>The mouse was invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1964 and 
consisted of a wooden shell, circuit board and two metal wheels
that came into contact with the surface it was being used on.</p>

<h2>Monitor</h2>
<img height="200" src="http://panam.gateway.com/s/MONITOR/z00825/Z0082513.jpg">-
<p>A monitor is the screen component of a computer, especially a 
free-standing screen.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>The first computer monitors used cathode ray tubes (CRTs).
Prior to the advent of home computers in the late 1970s, it was 
common for a video display terminal (VDT) using a CRT to be 
physically integrated with a keyboard and other components of the
system in a single large chassis.</p>
