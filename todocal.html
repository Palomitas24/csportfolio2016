<h1>How to do the Calculator</h1>

<img height="250" src="images/calculator.png">

<div>You want to make a calculator? Don't worry this page is going to tell you how to make your very own calculator.</div>

<h2> You need 2 Files: HTML and Javascript </h2>

<img height="250" src="http://domenlightenment.com/images/c1sec1.png"> 

<div> You need at least two files to do your calculator: one for HTML and one for Javascript. For the html, you have to do the
navbar (explained at the How to do the Hardware Page) the inputs and dislpay of the variable, the dropdown for the math symbols
and the backgroun image (also explained at the How to do the Hardware Page). For the Javascript, you have to put variables,
functions, and value of each and every single math symbol.</div>

<h2>The HTML Page</h2>

<h3>The Dropdown</h3>

<img height="250" src="images/dropdown.png"> 

<div>This is the dropdown. The dropdowm help us to pick which math factor we want for our equation. Each symbol has a value that connects
to the javascript file. The id is the selctor, where it idtenfires the it is a dropdown and a selctor. </div>

<h3>Input, Button, and Scripts</h3>

<img height="250" src="images/input.png"> 

<div>This is the last parts of your html file. First the input. The input is where you type in the number you want to put for your
equation. There are two inputs in the calculator. One is for the first number (not shown in the picture) you want to for your equation and the second input
is for the  second number for the equation you want. The solve button, well solves your equation. But it has and id from the 
javascript file to solve the equation. The "div" is to display the answer of the calculator/equation, id equals to display the
answer. And lastly the script. The script is to transfer the data from the javascript file. So both files can work at the same time.
That's all in the HTML file, now into the Javascript.</div>

<h2>Javascript File</h2>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<img height="150" src="images/varjavascript.png"> 

<div>This section of the javascript is the variables. The variables tell what to do from the getElementById. From the getElementById.
it tells what specfic id for the element. For example, for var num1input = document.getElementbyId"(num1"); it tells the element 
to be a number for the first input. Same with the other elements. </div>

<h2> If Else/Function/Value</h2>

<img height="350" src="images/ifstatementjavaspript.png"> 

<div>This whole procces is the engine of the calculator. If it selecets a math symbol for your equation for the value, this  is the 
code for what every math symbol has to do if selceted. The code has if one symbol if it has to do this job, if not selcted do another
symbol and do that symbol. For example, if it is selcted to do addition, do addition. IF not, do subtuction, if not. else do divide,
and so on. I think the hardest job was to do the square root because I didn't understand it. But with help of friends, we figured it 
out.</div>

<h2>The Whole Code for the HTML and Javascript Files</h2>

<div>Here is all the code for both the HTML file and javascript:</div>
