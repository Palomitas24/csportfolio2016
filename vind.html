<h1> Vindinium Project</h1>

<h2>What is Vindinium?</h2>

<img height="250" src="http://img.linuxfr.org/img/687474703a2f2f73642d33333239342e64656469626f782e66722f7e6a6f656c2f76696e64696e69756d2e706e67/vindinium.png"> 

<div> Vindinium is a game, where you have to control your character through 
programing it. It is also known as an Artifical Intellengence programing challenge.
You have to take control of your hero, using the programing language
of your choice. You will fight with other AI (other players) in a number 
of turns. You have to fight, capture gold mines, with sometimes with Goblins
inside the mines protecting it, and survive by drinking cream soda. The hero, or
player with the most coins collected, wins. If two player gets the same 
ammount of gold when the turns run out, there will be a draw and
no one will win.</div>

<h2> Deciding What - Decide if Taverns, Mines, or Attack</h2>

<div> Here is my entire code for my hero for Vindinium: </div>

<div> Are you stuck on deciding what to program for your hero to look for mines, heal in the taverns, or be ready to
attack? Well you are not alone. I had a little trouble figuring what to put for my codes between the taverns,
mines, and ready to attack. But with help my my classmates I could figureout the codes to program my hero. You had
diffrent codes to find the mines ( where it could be nuetral or own by another player), find a tanver for health, or
just attack other player. As shown above, all that code I did was to program my hero to do all that stuff.</div>

<h2>What are Taverns? And the Coding of FInding Taverns</h2>

<img height="250" src="http://rwdc2.com/files/forest.png"> 

<div>You may be asking, what are taverns in Vindinium? Well taverns are "cream sodas" that your player take to heal
when your hero is losing health. As explained earlier, that the map generates randomly, which lands the taverns in random places 
in the map. To get to a tavern, you have to program your hero where the taverns are. Here is an example of my code 
for my hero to find the taverns to heal itself.</div>

<img height="150" src="images/Screenshot 2017-03-09 at 9.41.00 PM.png"> 

<div>In the code that I programed to my hero is to find the nearest tarven when my hero is losing health.This code is made 
to find the closest tavern and send my bot to that tavern to heal or tavern camp depending on the situation.</div>

<h2>What are Mines? And the Coding of Finding Mines</h2>

<div>What are mines in Vindinium? Mines contain gold, where a player have to collect gold to order to win the game. Mines are also
randomly genorated when a new map is making. So how can you know the your hero is collecting gold from the mines. Well, this is 
my code below on how i programed my hero to collect gold from mines:</div>

<img height="250" src="images/Screenshot 2017-03-09 at 9.42.28 PM.png"> 

<div>This code shows where the mines are. There are two code, one for the mines that are free and one for the mines tha that are 
taken from other bots. The top one shows  the free mines that are not taken by other players and can detcited them to be taken
over by my bot.The second is to find mines with other players taken. It will show my hero to go to the mine and fight the bot.</div>

<h2> How to Program your Hero to Attack?</h2>

<img height="300" src="images/Screenshot 2017-03-09 at 7.39.04 PM.png"> 

<div>How can you attack players in Vindinium? Well, with my code above, that's how I program my hero to attack other players' 
heros.I used the code where shows where other players are in the map. If it hits a another player, it will attack the player and
go back. It shows every positon of where the other players and be reasy to attack incase it touches another player in the game.</div>

<h2>What Have I learned?</h2>

<img height="250" src="https://wheelerblogs.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/wilf-logo.jpg"> 

<div> I learned a lot of new things during this third round of expedetions this past two weeks. It was challengeing how to program
my hero. But later I figureed it out with some help of my classmates. Programing your robot is a difficult thing to do. But after
a while and testing out the codes, I got used to expermienting my hero. I learned the programmers can spend a lot of time expermienting
on one thing but later</div>
