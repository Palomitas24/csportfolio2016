<div> The motherboard is a printed board contianing the main components of a 
computer, with connectors into which other circuits boards can be inserted. 

<h3>History</h3>
<p>The IBM, which invented most of the computer parts,invented the motherboard
in 1981.It helped to provide a platform for the computer using RAM
CPU,keyboards, and a mouse.</p>

<div>The Central Processing Unit is a part of the computer in which the 
operations are controlled and perform.


<h3> History</h3>
<p>The CPU was intoduced by Intel in 1972. It was called the 8008
processer. Which it helped control of the operations of the computer. </p>

<div>Random access memories (RAM) is a form of computer data
storage, allows data items to be read or written in almost 
the same amount of time.


<h3> History</h3>
<p>Vacuum Tubes were used to be the RAMs back in the day. They had

<div>A hard drive is a high-capacity, self-contained storage
device containing a read-write mechanism inside a sealed unit.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Invented in the 1950's by IBM, the frist hard drives used to be

<div>If you think of a bus, you may think of the transportation vehicle.
It's kinda like that. A BUS in computing is they connect the the internal
components of a computer. The BUS intended to connect to local devices.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>The BUS were first used in the IBM in the 1950's. They made it 
easier to connect to other parts of a computer, including the RAM
and motherboard.</p>
