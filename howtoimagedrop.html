<h1>How To Do A Dropdown When You Click On An Image?</h1>

<div>
<p>Ever wonder how did the text appeared and and then disappeared when you click on the image in the 'Which Sport is Better?'
page? In this page I'm going to explain how I made this and explaining how the variables, fuctions, and everything else that
works behind the coding.</p>
</div>    
    
<h2>The Whole Coding</h2>

<div>
<p>This right here is the coding behind the Dropdown.  I'll will show how to do it and how it works inside the coding. 
I'll explain it later, but for now I'm going to introduce you what I did. </p>
</div>

<h2>What I have created?</h2>

<div>
<p>What I created in the "Which Sport Is Better?' project, is when you click on the image (of which ever sport you wantet to 
learn from) the information of the sport pops down from the image. When you click on the image again, the information disappers
and hides behind the image. I wanted to do this because it was a easy, but not simple, thing to do. I chose to do sports for 
my topic because sports is life for me. Without sports, I woutldn't be me right now. Sports are my hobbies. I chose four sports,
between them are soccer, basketball, hockey, and baseball. I had to find out which sport is better than the others. By doing
this I typed what the sport is about, how it connects me, the rules of the game, and the pros and cons. When you click on the image 
the information of what I said in the last sentece will pop, at the bottom of the image. Click the image again, the information 
of the sport will disapear.</p>

<h2>What Is a Dropdown?</h2>

<img height="300" width="500" src="https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/10354/screenshots/984290/untitled-3.gif"></img>

<div>
<p>You are asking yourself, what is a dropdown? A dropdown is a list or items, or words, that appear when clicking on a 
button,text, or image. When you click on the image a dropdown will appear at the bottom of the image with information.</p>
</div>

<h2>How Does the Image Dropdown Work?</h2>

<div>
<p>To do the dropdown when you click on the image, you need two files: the HTML file and the Javascript file.</p>

<h3>HTML File</h3>

<img height="300" width="500" src="images/imagedrophtml.png"></img>

<p>In the HTML file, you have to start with putting your Id's. An id for you guys who don't know is the an is is an 
artibute specifies an unique id for a HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document). The id attribute is
most used to point a style in a style sheet, and by Javascript (via the HTML document) to manipulate the element with the specific 
id. For the downdrop to work, you need an id for both the image you going to click on and the information you want to type about 
your topic so it will been shown at the bottom of the image when you click it and disapear when you click it again. For example,
my id's for the dropdown was (I am going to include the soccer dropdown): for the image it was 'id="soccerpic"' and for the 
inforamtion about soccer, 'id="soccerInfo"'. This tells that in the Javascript file, where to find that id to do what part.
Also on the information , I used 'display:"none"' because when the the page loads, I don't want the information to appear. You
have to click on the image to see the information. Everytime you reload the page, the inforamation of the sport won't appear,
until you click on the image. Even when you click on the image and the text appear at the bottom, when you refresh the page
or  go in again, the text (information) won't appear.You also need the format "div" to make what information you want to put 
inside the div. The div is the id for the dropdwon to appear and disappear when you click on the image.</p>

<h3>Javascript File</h3>

<img height="300" width="500" src="images/imagedrop1.png"></img>

<p>Now lets talk about the Javascript file. As you see in the Images on the top of the page, there are many unifamiliar things you
won't get. Lets talk about the first part of the code to do the dropdown. As you see, there is var, which is variables for 
short in programing. Variables declarations are processed before any code is execued. Variables can be thought of named containers.
You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply naming the container. Once again I'm going to use 
the Soccer Dropdown as my example. As you see there are two variables for the soccer dropdown: 'var soccerInfo' and 'var 
'soccerpic'. Now the other part of the code is the '= document.getElementbyId()'. This makes the id from the HTML file transfer
to the Javascript file where variable in gets the id. For example my code was 'var soccerInfo = getElementbyId("soccerInfo").
So the soccer information is grabbed to do a function. I did the same thing for soccer image. We are now going to explain the middle and bottom of the code of the 
dropdown. Now you see the code 'soccerpic.addEventListener('click', function()' The addEventListener attach an event, for this instense
clicking on the image, handler to an element, so that you can do something useful when an even is triggered. In this code we have 
an if else statement. This if else statement is when the webpage is open, the display will be none (for the text(information))
When you click on the image, the if statement says to turn the style of display fron "none" to "block" where the text is shown
at the bottom of the image. Block makes the display to appear. The else statement is if "block" is shown and the image is clicked,
display "none" again. </p>

<div>
<p>Doing this project was kinda hard but kinda easy at the same time. At first doing it, I didn't understand what to do.
I didn't know where to start. I had a rough start. The HTML file was the easiest thing to do in this project. Cause of course,
HTML is the easiest to learn. At first, I just putted the navbar, images, and information of each sport. Later on, I included
the background of the page and the color and font of the words. Oh yeah, and the border and padding. Now I was stuck in the
 Javascript part. For one hour I was just staring at the screen and listieng to music. Then I asked Mr.Hesby for some help.
 I owe Mr.Hesby, because he helped me a lot and helped me understand more about computer science. He helped me on to put ids 
 in the HTML file then to do the variables to transfer the id to the Javascript file. How addEventListener makes the fuctions
 works. How to put everything in the center of the page and not in the left ot right. Many many more things I could say, but 
 it would be a long and very boring paragraph to do. At first, I thought it was going be hard and boring. But oh boy, Mr.Hesby
 proved me wrong. Now, I understand the concepts of computer science. It is easy and fun to program stuff. Thank you, Mr. Hesby!!!
