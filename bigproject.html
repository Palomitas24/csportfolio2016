<p style="text-align:center">Welcome to my final project. For this project we have to use our knowledge of computer science
(HTML, CSS, Javascrpit) to make our own website out of scratch. We can't use turtorials because we have to use our knowledge
of what we learinf throughout this expedtions course. What I did is an information page on which sports are better than each
other. The four sports I chose: soccer, basketball, hockey, and baseball. Hope you guys like this project.</p>

<div> 
<p style="text-align:center">Which sport is better? Do you have any clue which sport is better than an other? Don't worry,
that's why I created this page. For many of you guys don't know what sports are, sports is an activity involving physical
exertion and skill in which an individual or a team competes aganinst another or others for entertianment. For this page,
I'm going to show you the pros and cons of four of my favorite sports: soccer, basketball, hockey, and baseball.</p>

 <h3>What Is Soccer?</h3>   
 <p>Soccer, for the rest of the world it's football. But here in the United States it's soccer. I grew up playing soccer. Soccer
 is my life right now. It's the only thing that motivates me. I've been playing soccer for my whole life. Without soccer, I 
 wouldn't be who I am today. If you tell me who are my favorite soccer team is, I will tell you is Club America from Mexico, the
 San Jose Earhtquakes, and the Mexican National team. Now let's forget about me and talk about soccer(football). Soocer is a sport 
 where a game is played by two teams of eleven players on each side, with a round ball that may not be touched with the hands or 
 arms during play expexct the goalkeepers. The object of the game is to score goals by kicking or heading the ball into the opponents'
 goal. In this sport, you could a tie a game, expect in the playoffs or championships.Soccer is been played all over the world, acutally 
 its the sport most played ans watched in the world!</p>   

<h3>Rules of Soccer </h3>
<p>As in always sport, there are rules and instructions. These are the rules of soccer:</p>
<h4>No Hands</h4>
 <p>As already explained, players can't touch the ball with their hands or arms. Goalkeepers can touch it or grab the ball with
 thier hands, because that's thier job, to protect the goal.</p>
 <h4>Throw-ins</h4>
<p>A throw-in is taken when the ball crosses a sideline and leaves the field. The two basic soccer rules for a proper throw-in 
are to have both feet on the ground and to throw the ball withboth hands over the head.</p>
<h4>Corner Kicks and Goal Kicks</h4>
<p>A corner kick is taken when the ball leaves the field across the goal line (the end of the field). If the offensive team kicks
the ball, the play is restarted with a goal kick. If the defensive team kicks it out, the play is restarted with a corner kick, 
The goal kick is taken from anywhere inside the goal area box. It can be taken by any player. The ball must leave the Penalty Area 
before anyone can touch the ball. If the ball doesn't leave the Penalty Area then the kick must retake. The corner kick is taken
from the corner nearest to where the ball left the field.</p>
<h4>Fouls</h4>
<p>The common rule on fouls is "If it looks like a foul, it probably is." A player can't kick trip, jump at, charge, strike, push,
hold, or spit at an opponent. Bumping, leaning or going shoulder to shoulder while competing for a ball is not a foul until the 
hands or elbows come up. </p>
<h4>Penalty Kick</h4>
<p>A penalty kick results from contact foul or hand ball by the defending team within the penalty area, the large box on either 
end of the field. The ball is placed on the penalty spot, in front of the center of the goal. All players must remain outside the 
penalty area and the penalty arc until the ball is kicked. The goalkeeper must have both feet on the goal line until the ball is
kicked. If after the ball is kicked, it roubounds of the post or goalie, and stay on the field, the ball is "live" and anyone
can play it</p>
<h4>Offsides</h4>
<p>You can't be offside on a corner kick, goal kick, or throw-in. Also, it isn't a offense for a player to be in an offside position
The player must be involved in active play as determined by the referee to be called offside. A player is in an offside position if: he 
is nearer to his opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second to last opponent.</p>

<h3>Pros And Cons</h3>
<p>As already explained this page is about comparing which sport is better than the others and telling you information about that 
sport. So here we have a list about the pros and cons about soccer:</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<p>Helps You Physically Keep Fit</p>
<P>Mentally(Understanding What You Are Talking About)</P>
<p>Academically(A Lot of Univesities look for soccer players, can give you scholarships and degrees)</p>

<h3>What is Basketball?</h3>
<p>Ah, basketball. My second favorite sport behind soccer. My mom first tuaght me about basketball. She used to play basketball 
when she was in her childhood in Mexico. I've been playing basketball since third grade. My favorite team is the Golden State
Warriors (DON'T CALL ME A BANDWAGON, BECAUSE I SUPPORTED THE WARRIORS IN 2007 BEFORE STEPHEN CURRY WAS EVEN IN THE TEAM). Now
to the question, what is basketball? Basketball is an another sport where a game is played between two teams of five players in 
which points are scored by throwing a ball through a netted hoop fixed above each end of the court. Or in other words the game is 
played with 2 teams, each team consits of 5 players at a time. The object of the game is to outsocre your opponent by shooting the ball 
into your basket and preventing them from puting the ball in theirs. The ball can be advanced up the floor with thier hands only, either
by dribbling or passing to teamates. Both the sport and the ball of the sport are called basketball. Basketball is very common in 
the United States, besides football(American football) and baseball.The NBA (National Basketball Association) in the United States
is the most famous basketball league in the world. Many people around the world support a team in the NBA and watch their games.</p>

<h3>Rules of Basketball</h3>
<p>As in all sports, there are rules ans instructions. Here are the rules for basketball:</p>

<h4>Starting Play</h4>
<p>Teams are assigned a basket at which to shoot for the first half, and switches enda at the half time. The game begins with 
a jump ball at center court between one player from each team. Other players line up around the center 
circle of the court. One the ball is touched by either player, the game begins.</p>

<h4>Fouls</h4>
<p>There are many types of fouls. FIrst is the personal fouls. Personal fouls include any type of illegal physical contact like
hitting,pushing,slapping,holding, and illegal pick/screen. When this happenes they get a personal foul penalty. If a player is shooting
while being fouled, then he gets two free throws if his shot doesn't go in, but only on free throw is his shot does go in. Charging,
an offensive foul that is commited when a player pushes or runs over a defensive player. The ball is given to the team that foul was
commited upon. Blocking, a foul where it's illegal personal contact resulting from from a defender not establishing position in time 
to prevent an opponent's drive to the basket. A flagrant foul is a violent contact with an opponent. This includes hitting, kicking,
and punching. This type of results in free throws plus the offense retaining possession of the ball after the free throws. Intentional 
fouls are whn a player makes physical contact with another player with no reasonable effort to steal the ball. It is a judgment call for
the officials. Lastly , we have the technical foul. A player or coach can commit this type of foul. It does not involve player contact 
or the ball but is instead about the 'manners' of the game. Foul language, obscenity, obsence gestures, and even arguing can be considered
a technical foul, as can technical details regarding filling in the scorebook improperly or dunking during warm-ups.</p>

<h4>Violations</h4>
<p>There are many violations the players commit during the game. Here are some violations players commit. Walking or Traveling, taking 
more than 'a step and a half' without dribbling the ball is trraveling. Moving your piviot foot once you've stopped dribbling is travel
Carrying or palming, when a player dribbles the ball with his hands too far to the side of or, sometimes, even under the ball. Double 
dribble is when dribbling the ball with both hands on the ball at the same time or picking up the dribble and then dribbling again is 
a double dribble. Goaltending is wehn a defensive player interferes with a shot while it's on the way down toward the basket, while it's 
on the way up toward the basket after having touched the backboard, or while it's in the cylinder above the rim, its goaltending and 
the shot counts. If commited by an offensive player, it's a violation and the ball is awarded to the opposing team for a throw-in. 
Backboard violation is when once the offense has brough the ball across the mid-court line, they cannot go back across the line during 
possession. If they do, the ball is awarded to the other team to pass inbounds. Lastly, time restrictions. A player passing the ball 
inbounds has five seconds to pass the ball. If he or she does not, then the ball is awarded to the other team. Other time restrictions 
include the rule that a player can't have theball for more than five seconds when being closely guarded and, in some states and levels, 
shot-clock restrictions requiring a team to attempt a shot within a given time fram</p> 

<h4>WHat Do Players Do?</h4>
<p>Players in basketball do some of fundmentals to play basketball: shooting, passing, dribbling, lay ups, jump stops, pivoting/footwork,
jab steps, screening, cutting, defense, and lastly rebounding.</p>

<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
<p>As already explained this page is about comparing which sport is better than the others and telling you information about that 
sport. So here we have a list about the pros and cons about basketball:</p>

<h3>What Is Hockey?</h3>
<p>My third favorite sport, hockey was one heck of a sport for me. I first started playing hockey since third grade. But it wasn't
ice hockey I played. I played street hockey. What's the diffrence, you say? Well in regular ice hockey, you skate on the ice in a 
ice rink. In street hockey, you run. No skates, just running. My favorite hockey team are the San Jose Sharks. Now to the question,
what is hockey? Hockey is a sport where it's a fast contact sport played on an ice rink between two teams of six skaters, who attempt
to drive a small rubber disk (the puck) into the opposing goal with hooked ot angled sticks.</p>

<h3>Rules Of Hockey</h3>
<p>As in all sports, there are rules ans instructions. Here are the rules for hockey: </p>
  
<h3>Hockey's Three Main Rules</h3>
<h4>Offsides</h4>
<p>Offfsides is when any member of the attacking team precedes the puck over the defending team's blue line</p>
    
    
<h4>Offside (or two-line) Pass</h4>
<p>When a player passess the puck from his defending zone to a teammate beyond the red center line.</p>

<h4>Icing</h4>
<p>When a player shoots the puck across the center red line and past the opposing red line. Icing is not called if the players team 
is killing a penalty, a teammate of the player shooting the puck touches it before a player from the opposing team, the defending goalie 
touches the puck first or if the puck travels through the crease on its way to the red line</p>
    
<h3>The Penalties </h3>    
<p>A team plays shorthanded when one or more of its players is charged with a penalty. However, no team is forced to play more than two 
players below full strength (six) at any tiime. If a third penalty is assessed to the same team, it is suspended until the first penalty
expires. When a penalty is called on a goalie, a teammate serves his time in the penalty box.</p>    

<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<p>Aerobic Exercise</p> 
<p>Character Building</p>
<p>A Life-Long Sport</p>
    
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p>There Are Near Deaths And Seriours Injuries</p>
<p>There's Lots Of Fighting</p>

<h3>What Is Baseball?</h3>
<p>Now we are going to talk about a sport I don't play and don't like really much. Baseball, Americas sport. Baseball is a sport where a 
a game of ball between two nine-player teams play usually for nine innings on a field. The field has a focal point, a diamond-shaped infield
with a home plate and three other bases around the infield, 90 feet apart. The bases form a circuit taht must be completed by a base runner
in order to score. The central offfensive action entailing hitting a pitched ball with a wooden or metal bat and run to the bases. The winner 
of the game is the team the scores the most runs. So, that's what baseball is. My favorite baseball team are the San Francisco Giants. Like I 
say, I don't like baseball, but I still wanted to research on this sport.</p>

<h3>Rules Of Baseball</h3>    
<p>As in all sports, there are rules ans instructions. Here are the rules for baseball:</p>
 
 <h4>Starting Play</h4>
 <p>The visting team bats first while the home team starts out in the field on defense. Each fielder lines up in one of the 9 fielding positions.
 The first batter steps into the batter's box and prepares to hit the pitch.</p>
 
 <h4>Batting</h4>
 <p>There is a batter's box on both sides of home plate. The batter may choose which side of the plate to hit from, but both of his feet must be 
 inside the box. He attempts to score runs by hitting the ball when it's pitched to him. The batter may continue to hit until he: hits the ball
 into fair territory, gets 3 strikes, or gets 4 balls.</p>
 
 <h4>Strikes</h4>
 <p>The strike zone is the area between the batter's shoulders and knees. A strike is called by the umpire (the ref) when the batter: fails 
 to swing at a pitch that crosses the plate in the strike zone, swings at a pitch and misses, or hits the ball out of bounds with fewer than 
 two strikes against him. Once he gets 3 strikes, he is out, and the next batter comes up to the plate. A batter can't strike out on a foul 
 ball. If he has two strikes, there is no limit to the number of the fouls balls he is allowed to hit. He can only strike out on a swing and
 miss or a ball he fails to swing at in the strike zone.</p>
 
 <h4>Balls</h4>
 <p>A ball is a pitch the crosses the plate outside of the strike zone that the batter doesn't swing at. If a batter receives 4 balls, he gets
 to walk to first base. If a batter swings at a ball outside the strike zone and misses, he is called for a strike.</p>

<h4>Runner</h4>
<p>The batter becomes a runner when: he hits a ball in fair territory and qruns to first base, he walks after 4 balls, he is hit by a pitch
or the catcher drops the third strike (If the batter is callled for his 3rd strike but the catcher misses the ball, the batter may try to 
beat the ball to first base). A runner can move to the next base if the ball is overthrown or after a wild pitch. A runner may overrun 1st 
base when he hits the ball as long as he turns out of bounds after he passes the base. Runners may not overrun any other base. If they do 
and are tagged while they are off the base, they are out.</p>

<h4>Scoring</h4>
<p>The team that scores the most runs is the winner. A run is scored when a base runner rounds all of the bases be stepping on each one in 
order from 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and crosses home plate. If the ball is hit over the outfield fence in fair territory, it is considered a home run 
the batter has a 'free trip' all the way around the bases until he crosses home plate. A Grand Slam is a home run that's hit with the bases 
loaded (runners on every base). All of the base runners round the bases and go home for a total of 4 points (runs).</p>

<h4>Putting Players Out</h4>
<p>As already explained, a batter is out if : he hits the ball and it's caught while it's in the air, which is know as a fly ball (even if 
it's cuaght in foul territor) or when he gets 3 strikes. A runner is out if: he is hit by a batted ball while off a base, a fielder tags 
him with the ball when he is not touching a base, he runs more than 3 feet out of the baseline to avoid being tagged, a fielder with the ball 
tags a base at which there is a force play before the forced runner reaches the base, or he runs past the base runner that's ahead of him</p>

<h4>Plays</h4>
<p>Double Play</p>
<P>When 2 players get out on the same play.</P>
<p>Triple Play</p>
<p>When 3 players get out on the same play.</p>
<p>Force Play</p>
<p>When a batter hits the ball and runs to 1st base, he forces the runner on 1st base to 2nd base. If there's also a runner on 2nd, he must move 
to 3rd base, and  if there's also a runner on 3rd base, he must run to home plate. A runner is out if he is tagged by a fielder before reaching the 
base he is forced to run to or if a fielder with a ball touches the base before he gets there. </p>

<h4>Other Rules</h4>
<p>Steals</p>
<p>When a runner runs to the next base without the ball ebing hit, usually before the pitcher pitches the ball. The runner is out if he is tagged with the 
ball before reaching the base.</p>
<p>Tagging Up</p>
<p>When a fielder catches a fly ball, a runner cannot leave the base until after the ball hits the fielder's gloave. If he leaves the base too early, he has to 
go back and touch the base before he can run to the next base. If the ball gets to his bease before he returns ti tag up, he os put,</p>

<h3>Pros And Cons</h3>

<p>Leadership</p>
<p>Communication</p>
<p>Arm Stregnth</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p>Some Players Cheat (Taking Drugs)</p>
